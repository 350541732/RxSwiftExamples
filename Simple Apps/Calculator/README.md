# Calculator app (Not finished)
This app is mostly just a showcase of how could you do the simple app like Calculator in
"not-that-simple" way. This partly works and I probably won't find time to finish it in the near future, so it is here only as a show-off how you can complicate a task called Calculator. Still it was a funny way of trying out new stuff. If you want another view on that matter, check [this](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxExample/RxExample/Examples/Calculator) calculator in RxSwift examples.
