## List of examples
- [ColourfulBall](https://github.com/DroidsOnRoids/RxSwiftExamples/tree/master/Simple%20Apps/ColourfulBall) - this is example of using MVVM and animations with RxSwift. Bindings and stuff. Previously RxViewModelExample. 
- [Calculator](https://github.com/DroidsOnRoids/RxSwiftExamples/tree/master/Simple%20Apps/Calculator) - this one is not done and probably won't be done since it is already in RxExamples in RxSwift repository.
