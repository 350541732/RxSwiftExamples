# Calculator app (WORK IN PROGRESS!)
This app is mostly just a showcase of how could you do the simple app like Calculator in
"not-that-simple" way. Mostly I'm using <b>MVVM</b>, API (to currency exchanges) etc.
If you want another view on that matter, check [this](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxExample/RxExample/Examples/Calculator) calculator in RxSwift examples.
