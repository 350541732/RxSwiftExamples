# RxSwiftExamples

Here you have set of examples with usage of [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and modules from [RxSwiftCommunity](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity).
It is written to help starting off with `RxSwift` and show that its really fun.
Every example <i>should be</i> commented (if it's not, I'm working on it) with basic idea of usage in the main controller and every confusing line should be commented as well. <br />
Also, please remember that this is work in progress. ✌️

2. [RxSwift by Examples #2 – Observable and the Bind](http://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/ios/rxswift-by-examples-2-observable-and-the-bind/). Here we talk about binding and variables based on the [RxViewModelExample](https://github.com/DroidsOnRoids/RxSwiftExamples/tree/master/Libraries%20Usage/RxViewModelExample) repo.

## Table of contents
1. `Libraries Usage` consists of examples of specific libraries, with the basic one `RxSwiftExample` and
others from the community. If you have any library that is interesting, please make an issue or pull request
with adding the library to Todolist.
2. `Simple Apps` consists of apps that are written with `RxSwift`, but also with usage of multiple other libraries or without any - it's kinda random. It is more focused on getting the App done rather than use specific library.
